Hi there! Welcome to my first HTML/Javascript project!

I'm fullfilled with exitement to tell you that it's my first website.
I know, it's simple, but it's a big event for me!

Here is the link to this website: https://learnmore-smart.github.io/Color-Flipper/

It's an background color page, where you can click on diverses buttons to make  the background of the page change its color.
The available buttons are : blue, red, green and random.

Enjoy~
