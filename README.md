Hi there! Welcome to my first HTML/Javascript project!

I'm fullfilled with exitement to announce this to you - my first website.
I know, it's simple, just a small step, but a big achievement! (for me, personnally)

Here is the link to this website: https://learnmore-smart.github.io/Color-Flipper/

It's an background color page, a wonderful place where you can click on diverses buttons to make the page change its color.
The available buttons are : blue, red, green and random(infinite choices!).

Enjoy~
